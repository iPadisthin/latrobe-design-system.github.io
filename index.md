title: "About Wedgetail"
status: draft
info: Wedgetail is La Trobe University's open-source design system for digital products and experiences. With the La Trobe Design Language as its foundation, the system consists of working code, design tools and resources, human interface guidelines, and a vibrant community of contributors.
---

We use Wedgetail in our design/development process to design, develop and test new and updated UI components.
This design system also acts as the specification for CMS integrators and developers.

## Three Guiding Principles

### 1. Simple Build

This design system has been created to provide La Trobe University with a resource of living design patterns. The system aims to be cohesive, dynamic, reusable and maintable both in design and code.

### 2. Design for Flexibility

Using a design system ensures patterns adapt correctly to meet user needs, offering variation, and yet, providing design consistency and familiarity. It also allows us to build components that work well in multiple digital channels.

### 3. Reuseable Best Practices

Design, develop, test, review, and repurpose patterns, code, and design. That results in a comprehensive collection of tried-and-tested assets that reflect industry best practices.


## Status labels

The status scale is a way to indicate the level of robustness of any pattern in this style guide. New patterns should be released into the style guide following these rules, assess each pattern independently.

### Planned
- The user need has been identified, but the approach to solving the problem has not yet been decided.
- The team has decided to tackle this UI pattern.
- Pattern has been listed in the Roadmap.

### Draft
Includes everything from the Planned phase, as well as:

- Pattern is actively being defined. Use at risk, and with caution.
- Pattern may be generally usable for people with relatively “normal” digital literacy.
- Pattern is not approved for for use in production.
- Documentation may/may not be complete.

### Ready
Includes everything in the Planned and Draft phases, as well as:

- Pattern works in multiple configurations, and with other patterns in the Style Guide.
- Pattern is usable, on multiple devices/browsers.
- Pattern considers people with multiple disabilities (blind, low vision, cognitive disabilities, motor disabilities, low language skills, low digital literacy, etc.).
- Pattern has been reviewed by internal/external teams.
- The pattern has passed any heuristic assessments.
- Documentation is complete.

### Retired
- Pattern is no longer fit for purpose
- It should be removed from production, and will be removed from the Style Guide in due course.
