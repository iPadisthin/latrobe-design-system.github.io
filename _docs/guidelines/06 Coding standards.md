## Coding conventions

The Wedgetail design system is based off [Maintainablecss](https://maintainablecss.com/)

```
.<module>[-<component>][-<state>] {}
```


```
/* Module container */
.searchResults {}

/* Component */
.searchResults-heading {}

/* State */
.searchResults-isLoading {}
```

### 

### CSS class convention

We are using the following convention:

.component[-<subcomponent>]

E.g
