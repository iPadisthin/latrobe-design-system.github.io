## Type tokens and sets

Wedgetail uses type tokens and themes to manage typography. Type tokens are pre-set configurations of typographic elements such as font size, weight, or leading (line height) that are specifically calibrated for use alongside IBM Plex in product. Selecting the appropriate type style is determined by layout or template structure. Layouts may have several levels of architecture or areas that require varying typographic hierarchies.

## Typeface: Roboto

Wedgetail uses the open-source typeface Roboto. It has been carefully designed to meet La Trobe's needs and reflect La Trobe's spirit, beliefs, and design principles. Roboto can be accessed and downloaded from Google Fonts.

The main CSS file only makes use of it in 4 instances:

* Pull quotes.
* Intro paragraphs in news articles section - I couldn't find an example on the web.
* Attribution paragraphs in Profiles section - I couldn't find an example on the web.
* First paragraph in cross promo  - I couldn't find an example on the web.

__!!!AJP!!! We should replace this with a system font - e.g. <span style="font-family: Georgia">Georgia</span> - the extra font download is not worth it for these four uses!__
