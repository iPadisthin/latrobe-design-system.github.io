## Designing with icons <a name="designing-with-icons"></a>

### Sizing

Wedgetail components typically use icons on 16px artboards. Icons on 20px, 24px, and 32px artboards can also be used within the UI. Be sure icon size is consistent throughout your product.

### Touch targets

All touch targets for interactive icons need to be 44px or larger. Developers can add padding to a touch target with CSS to meet the 44px requirement.

### Colour

Icons are always a solid, monochromatic color and need to pass the same color contrast ratio as typography (4.5:1). The color of the icon should reflect the importance of the iconâ€™s action which should always be to help guide a user. For more information on color, see the Color guidelines.

### Alignment

When used next to text, icons should be center-aligned.
