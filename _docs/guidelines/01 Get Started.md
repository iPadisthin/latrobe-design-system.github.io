There are many ways to get started with the Wedgetail Design System. It all depends on your project's needs and whether you are a developer or a designer (or somewhere in between).

There are three ways to get started with the Design System;

1. Visit out Wedgetail repo on GitHub and clone to your machine
2. For designers, visit our download page to use design assets in sketch
3. For full page templates, download the design system starter kit

Once you have the components in a website we have advanced guides for developers on how to:

- Customise the colour scheme
- How to use the font size and space functions
- Customise existing components
- Create a new component
- Set up a development environment
- Spacing between components
- The advanced guides assume prior knowledge of npm and SASS.

Throughout the process you may notice issues, missing features or have ideas for new components. If you would like to contribute or help build the future of Wedgetail you can 

- Join the community
- Submit a bug report
- Submit a feature request
- Suggest a component

<!-- 
## Step 1 -  Design
Wedgetail provides designers with the guidelines for creating new patterns in a modular way.

## Step 2 - Prototype
The design is prototyped in the design system and the design is refined in the browser.
The prototype process:
1. The design is analaysed to determine which 

## Step 3 - Development
The entire Wedgetail design system can be cloned from github or you can choose to clone down the packages you require as needed.

## Approving a new pattern
Any new pattern that is created that is not in Wedgetail is tested against strict criteria before it can enter the system. If there are only slight design variations or there is an existing pattern that already does it's job, the pattern will be rejected. This process is important so the highest quality patterns are maintained. A design can download the complete pattern library and use within sketch. -->
