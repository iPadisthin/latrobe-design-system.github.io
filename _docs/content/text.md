By default all text is set to wrap at 80 characters to achieve a readable line length. 

Readable line lengths make text a lot more comfortable to read and scan and thus absorb information more readaly.


## Accessibility

Readable line lengths are also now part of the WCAG accessibility standard: https://www.w3.org/TR/2008/REC-WCAG20-20081211/#visual-audio-contrast-visual-presentation.
