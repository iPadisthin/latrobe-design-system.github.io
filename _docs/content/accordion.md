Accordions help users see only the content they need. Accordions expand and collapse sections of content.
{: .intro}

Accordions should be used sparingly! Content should only be hidden for well considered reasons.
{: .alert .alert--info}

Accordions are good for:
* **Selective content:** i.e. there may be many sections under a given topic but only a few sections apply to a given individual at a time.
* **Complex process overviews:** with the detail of each step hidden. See the [Sample 2](#accordion-sample-2) below.

## Accessibilty

Accordion has been built in accordance with https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-practices-1.1/#accordion

The heading level for each accordion heading should fit correctly within the outline of the page. Headings within the content of each accordion should follow from there.
