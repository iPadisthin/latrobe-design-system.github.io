The Wedgetail Design system provides:
1. a framework for scalable, maintainable and iterative design and development of the UI of the La Trobe University web site.
2. a collection of modular components, guided by clear standards, that can be assembled together to build any number of pages/applications maintaining consistency of design and user experience.

## Principles

### Atomic design

We use the [atomic design](https://atomicdesign.bradfrost.com/chapter-2/) approach to create a modular design system.

### Responsive design

We use the Responsive Design approach to create a device agnostic solution.

### Iterative design



### Accessibility

The modular approach allows Accessibility to be achieved at the component level.
