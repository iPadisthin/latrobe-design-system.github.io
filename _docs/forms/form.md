Examples and usage guidelines for form control styles and layout.
{: .intro}

## Overview
Forms comprise of the form itself and multiple form inputs.

Each label and input pair are always wrapped by a [form-group](/forms/form-group.html).

Avoid hiding form labels and relying on placeholders as a label. Placeholder contrast is not visually accessible.
