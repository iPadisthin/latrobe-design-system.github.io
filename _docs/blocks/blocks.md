Blocks are used to stack content sections on a page. All components and elements are placed within a block.

Blocks have an optional header with with optional heading (h2) and description.

Blocks are always <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> elements. We are NOT using the <code>&lt;section&gt;</code> element as we are using implicit sectioning (i.e. sectioning based on heading hierarchy).
