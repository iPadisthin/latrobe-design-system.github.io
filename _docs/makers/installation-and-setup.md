We have created a starter kit with templates that can get you up and running with the design system. You can view the live version or go to the starter kit GitHub repository to download the code.

The starter kit requires Node.js version 8 or higher. See the Node.js/npm installation guides if you require assistance installing node.

### 1. Download the starter kit

### 2. To install Jekyll**

1. Install Jekyll `gem install jekyll bundler`
2. If Ruby is not installed follow the instructions here: https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/
3. gem update github-pages


### 3. In terminal open this folder and run npm install. This will install dependencies necessary for the local development environment.

### 4. You can now start your local server by running npm run watch. This will check for file changes, when it occurs the server will build your site refresh the browser.
