title: Design Principle
info: This style guide has been created to help designers, developers and product owners create and maintain user interface documentation in a 'Style Guide'.

[//]: # "TODO: Needs rewriting in relation to La Trobe"

## Three Guiding Principles

### 1. Simple Build

This design system has been created to provide La Trobe University with a resource of living design patterns. The system aims to be cohesive, dynamic, reusable and maintable both in design and code.

### 2. Design for Flexibility

Using a design system ensures patterns adapt correctly to meet user needs, offering variation, and yet, providing design consistency and familiarity. It also allows us to build components that work well in multiple digital channels.

### 3. Reuseable Best Practices

Design, develop, test, review, and repurpose patterns, code, and design. That results in a comprehensive collection of tried-and-tested assets that reflect industry best practices.
