<div class="alert alert-text-box alert-info" role="alert">
    <h3>This is a info alert â€” check it out!</h3>

    <p>Aww yeah, you successfully read this important alert message. This example text is going to run a bit longer so that you can see how spacing within an alert works with this kind of content.</p>

    <p>Whenever you need to, be sure to use margin utilities to keep things nice and tidy.</p>
