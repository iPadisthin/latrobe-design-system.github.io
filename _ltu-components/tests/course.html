        <h3>Advanced standing - credit for prior study</h3>
        <p>Advanced Standing is the recognition of previous study or learning that can be counted towards a
            qualification. This can reduce the number of subjects required to complete your course. The amount of credit
            received depends on the level and relevance of your previous tertiary study and the number of subjects
            completed. The University will designate courses where there is only admission into Year 1 of the course. In
            these cases, there is limited advanced standing.</p>
        <p>To check if this course is available for advanced standing, please visit the <a
